    //as it is an attribute to that class.

//In Java:

    //The static keyword means that something belongs to the class itself, rather than to instances (objects) of the class.
    //static is mainly used with nested classes, methods, and variables.

// Now â€” for outermost (top-level) classes:

    //Top-level classes are not members of any other class.
    //Since static is a modifier that applies to members of a class (like inner classes or methods),
    // it does not make sense to apply it to a top-level class.

    //In simpler terms: ðŸ‘‰ A static class needs a surrounding class to belong to â€” and a top-level class has none.
